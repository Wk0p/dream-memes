        <h2>What we offer</h2>
		<div>
		<h2>Logo design:</h2>
			<p id="pone">Logo Design is crucial to your Business Image. Logos can often be the first impression that a potential client gets of your business.

Your logo is the visual shorthand for your business.<br><br>Before we begin designing your logo, we like to take the time to get a feel for your business, understand your products / services and know where you visualise your company in the future. And here in our Studio in Dublin, while working closely with you, we can achieve a logo that works for you and your business.</p>

	  <h2>Branding:</h2>
	  
	  
      <p id="pone">Branding is a huge part of how your business is perceived by potential clients. It must deliver your message clearly, connect with your target audience, motivate a potential buyer and maintain client loyalty. At every point of contact with the public, your branding must be strong, recognisable and clear.<br><br>Branding appears everywhere from business cards, letterheads, invoices, compliment slips, vouchers, price lists, brochures, reports, flyers, leaflets, adverts – online and press, websites, vehicles, signage, vehicles, promotional gifts….the list is endless but it all has one aim – to promote your business and motivate potential consumers to contact you.</p>

<h2>Leaflet, Poster & Menu Design:</h2>	

<p>Leaflets and Flyers are a great way to drive a promotion and publicise your business. Leaflet design needs to be informative (without being cluttered) and eye catching, having immediate impact. Even though leaflets may seem to be a small marketing tool – we think they can have a big impact.<<br><br>>Using concise text content, strong typography, appropriate colour choice, striking imagery and an easy-to-follow layout – we can convey your message in a positive way to your target market. Good leaflet design and good flyer design are vital in any successful business promotional drive.<br><br>Strong, clear poster design will create a curiosity and draw people in to learn more. Posters create visual impact and attract a particular target market. They inform and create awareness.</p>
<h3>Packaging Design</h3>

<p>It’s estimated that the average consumer spends less than a second scanning the shelf, and in that time, will make a decision on whether or not to purchase any given product.<br><br>So our job is to make sure that your product is the one that the consumer wants to pick up, read about and buy.<br><br>Packaging design focuses on producing a container that will get noticed. By skillfully teaming colourful graphics, a unique shape, strong typography or any other eye-catching method, we help achieve this. No matter how beneficial the product inside the container may be, unless a consumer decides to pick it up, that product will never get tested.  We will work closely with you to get your product noticed and purchased.</p>

<h1 id="header">What Core Technology do we use?</h1>
     <p id="pone">We use the following programming languages for the creation of websites: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), Bootstrap and jQueary. For more information about these, please read below.</p>
	 <h2>HTML</h2>
	 <p id="pone">HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Language, is a 20+ year old markup language for the creation of websites. It semantically describes the web, meaning that it allows the machine to understand what we want from it. It allows the machine to ‘interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.’</p>
	 
	 <p id="pone">It was created by created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 who had the intention of it being a way to easily share information, however it officially was published in 1993, then again in 1995 with minor changes, followed by January 1997 and December 1997. With various minor updates here and there HTML5 -which is the current version was released in 2014</p>
	 
	 <p id="pone">It is the basic of all websites, the basic layout, the structure, the start of it all. Without the HTML there can’t be any CSS or JavaScript, however it can exist on its own. CSS and JS can assist in HTML to look or act differently.</p>
	 
	 <p id="pone">The way that HTML works is that it is based on elements, which are the building blocks of the website. Each element is made up of tags, such tags usually look something like this &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;p>. Each tag has its own property - it might be how it looks, or how it is placed by default on the web. The ‘<’ opens the tag, and ‘>’ closes it, each element needs to be opened and closed with the right tag. And each opening tag, has to have a closing tag. The closing tags are a copy of the opening but have a ‘/’ in front of the first letter of the tag.</p>
	 
	 <h2>CSS</h2>
	 <p id="pone">CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a coding language that assists the creation of a website. It is what allows that one thing to be placed exactly in that one spot, it is responsible for the presentation of the HTML. It is responsible for fonts, colours, position, background, opacity and so much more.</p>
	 
	 <p id="pone">Like HTML it is over 20 years old but CSS was developed after. It was first proposed in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie and then published in 1996. Like the HTML code it went through various updates throughout the years</p>
	 
	 <p id="pone">Now, since it is called a cascading style sheet, it means that the order that it is coded in is very important. As the last line of code is the newest line of code it means that it higher in hierarchy than the last. Therefore, if the code looked something like this, the font would e blue and not red</p>
	 
	<p id="pone"> p{ Font-color: red; } <br> p{ Font-color: blue; } </p>
	 
	<p id="pone"> To further breakdown that code the ‘p{‘ is the selector - it is what specifies what is going to be changed, it can also use ID and Classes which are ways to identify different elements of the HTML. </p>
	<p id="pone"> The ‘p{‘ is then followed by the declaration. ‘Font-color;’ as the name suggests, this is targeting the colour of the text and the ‘blue;’ defines what colour you want to change it to, if you want to be more specific with colour then you can use hex codes which is a 6-digit code for any colour or shade there is. Finally the ‘}’ is  still part of the declaration but it is used at the very end, when you do not want to target anything else for that element.</p> 
	
	<h2>JavaScript</h2>
	<p id="pone"> Lastly JavaScript or JS is the coding language that is responsible for (Not to be confused with Java, JScript, JQueary or Javanese script.) How the website responds. Small things like the current date or time showing, that super smooth scrolling motion or the fact that when you click on a heading the site scrolls down to that section for you, that is all because of JS.</p>
