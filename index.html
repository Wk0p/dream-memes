      <h1 id="header">Graphic Design</h1>
     <p id="pone">Here at XYZ we offer the best there is, for the best. Our primary service is graphic design, and out goal is to help you with any and all designs, to bring you the quality you deserve.<br><br>We have a skilled, creative team that have over 30 years of expiriance combined in the industry. We have a mix of the younger and older generation so you can be sure that the design will appeal to all ages. </p>
        <h2>What we offer</h2>
		<h3>Logo design:</h3>
			<p>Logo Design is crucial to your Business Image. Logos can often be the first impression that a potential client gets of your business. It appears on your business cards, letterheads, invoices, advertisements, PR material and website. This is why your logo needs to be well thought out, clear and visually pleasing. Your logo is the visual shorthand for your business.<br><br>Before we begin designing your logo, we like to take the time to get a feel for your business, understand your products / services and know where you visualise your company in the future. And here in our Studio in Dublin, while working closely with you, we can achieve a logo that works for you and your business.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Branding:</h3>
	  
	  
      <p>Branding is a huge part of how your business is perceived by potential clients. It must deliver your message clearly, connect with your target audience, motivate a potential buyer and maintain client loyalty. At every point of contact with the public, your branding must be strong, recognisable and clear.<br><br>Branding appears everywhere from business cards, letterheads, invoices, compliment slips, vouchers, price lists, brochures, reports, flyers, leaflets, adverts – online and press, websites, vehicles, signage, vehicles, promotional gifts….the list is endless but it all has one aim – to promote your business and motivate potential consumers to contact you.</p>

<h3>Leaflet, Poster & Menu Design:</h3>	

<p>Leaflets and Flyers are a great way to drive a promotion and publicise your business. Leaflet design needs to be informative (without being cluttered) and eye catching, having immediate impact. Even though leaflets may seem to be a small marketing tool – we think they can have a big impact.<<br><br>>Using concise text content, strong typography, appropriate colour choice, striking imagery and an easy-to-follow layout – we can convey your message in a positive way to your target market. Good leaflet design and good flyer design are vital in any successful business promotional drive.<br><br>Strong, clear poster design will create a curiosity and draw people in to learn more. Posters create visual impact and attract a particular target market. They inform and create awareness.</p>
<h3>Packaging Design</h3>

<p>It’s estimated that the average consumer spends less than a second scanning the shelf, and in that time, will make a decision on whether or not to purchase any given product.<br><br>So our job is to make sure that your product is the one that the consumer wants to pick up, read about and buy.<br><br>Packaging design focuses on producing a container that will get noticed. By skillfully teaming colourful graphics, a unique shape, strong typography or any other eye-catching method, we help achieve this. No matter how beneficial the product inside the container may be, unless a consumer decides to pick it up, that product will never get tested.  We will work closely with you to get your product noticed and purchased.</p>
