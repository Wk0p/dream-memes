<h1>What do we do?</h1>
<br>
<h3 style="clear:both;">Branding:</h3>

<p id="pone">Branding is a huge part of how your business is perceived by potential clients. It must deliver your message clearly, connect with your target audience, motivate a potential buyer and maintain client loyalty. At every point of contact with the public, your branding must be strong, recognisable and clear.<br><br>Branding appears everywhere from business cards, letterheads, invoices, compliment slips, vouchers, price lists, brochures, reports, flyers, leaflets, adverts – online and press, websites, vehicles, signage, vehicles, promotional gifts….the list is endless but it all has one aim – to promote your business and motivate potential consumers to contact you.</p>

<h3>Leaflet, Poster &amp; Menu Design:</h3>	

<p>Leaflets and Flyers are a great way to drive a promotion and publicise your business. Leaflet design needs to be informative (without being cluttered) and eye catching, having immediate impact. Even though leaflets may seem to be a small marketing tool – we think they can have a big impact.&lt;<br><br>&gt;Using concise text content, strong typography, appropriate colour choice, striking imagery and an easy-to-follow layout – we can convey your message in a positive way to your target market. Good leaflet design and good flyer design are vital in any successful business promotional drive.<br><br>Strong, clear poster design will create a curiosity and draw people in to learn more. Posters create visual impact and attract a particular target market. They inform and create awareness.</p>
<h3>Packaging Design</h3>

<p>It’s estimated that the average consumer spends less than a second scanning the shelf, and in that time, will make a decision on whether or not to purchase any given product.<br><br>So our job is to make sure that your product is the one that the consumer wants to pick up, read about and buy.<br><br>Packaging design focuses on producing a container that will get noticed. By skillfully teaming colourful graphics, a unique shape, strong typography or any other eye-catching method, we help achieve this. No matter how beneficial the product inside the container may be, unless a consumer decides to pick it up, that product will never get tested.  We will work closely with you to get your product noticed and purchased.</p>

    <h3>UX Design & Development</h3>
	<p id="two">It all starts with an idea, sometimes yours, sometimes ours. It might be a plan to build something new, something groundbreaking. It might be driven by a market need to improve your software or to build a better experience for the customers who support your business.</p>

	  <h3 class="otherone">Build</h3>
	  
	        <p>Our front end developers take the designs and build out functioning prototypes. We use these to endorse the flow, the interactions and interface behaviours proposed in the designs. Our devs can then “buddy” with your programmers to build production ready software.</p>
<p>You will have full access to test out the prototypes, to contact the team about any changes or implementations you might want. This includes both mobile apps and sites, as well as everything in between.</p>
